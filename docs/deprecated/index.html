        Chaconne by JS Bach. I know, it's an obsession.

        1 theme of 8 bars (white) + 32 variations numbered from 1 to 32 (in colours) + a final chord (black).
    </p>
    <p>
        This count of variations (32 )can be questioned; some will say less (31), others more (33, even 34), the debate is legitimate. At some point one has to stop wracking his brains, quit intellectual (monkey spanking / chicken choking / pipe cleaning), and make a decision. Done!
    </p>
    <p>
        The theme is in D minor, and so are the first 16 variations, then 10 variations are in D major (Δ), then 6 final variations are back to D minor.

Most of the variations are 8 bars long, except for variations 8 and 31 (12 bars), and variations 10, 16, 19 and 30 (4 bars).
    </p>
    <p>
        Bottom line:

Theme: 8 bars
first group, *16* variations in D minor, #1 to #16:
132 - 8 = *128* bars

second group, *10* variations in D major, #17 to #26:
208 - 132 = *76* bars

third group, *6* variations in D minor, #27 to #32:
256 - 208 = *48* bars
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, the proportions of the 3 groups of variations.

1) In number of bars:

first group / second group = 128 / 76 ~= *1.68*
second group / third group = 76 / 48 ~= *1.58*
    </p>
    <p>
        2) In number of variations:

first group / second group= 16 / 10 = *1.60*
second group / third group = 10 / 6 ~= *1.67*

We can see that all these ratios are close to each other:

*1.68* ~= *1.58* ~= *1.60* ~= *1.67*
    </p>
    <p>
        *Golden Ratio!*

"Two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities". Which may be written: ( a + b ) / a = a / b with a > b.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio
    </p>
    <p>
        Three lines of elementary algebra later, we can express the ratio a/b, i.e. the golden ratio, denoted φ, as the unique positive solution of the equation φ² = φ + 1.

That is, φ ~= *1.618*
